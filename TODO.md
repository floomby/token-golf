## TODO

### Priority Stuff

- Clean up styling (add remove buttons color, restore button better, etc.)
- More testing

### Polish

- Think about best way to handle square image issue (should I crop before putting in db?)
- Fix firefox scrollbar not looking like chrome (the width needs to be the same because it is used in a css calc and leads to something being off center (by a couple pixels) in firefox)
- Fix suspense layout problems (which pages even need this?) (low priority)

### New Stuff

- Share to twitter button

### Beyond (requires more thinking)

- Commenting on challenges?
- Deleting challenges (think about deleting in general (should this delete scores?, etc...))
- Options for trim and case sensitivity in problem creation?
- Improve feed

### Backend Chores

- Type the trpc endpoints that are returning anys (one left I think)
