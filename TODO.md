## Roadmap Items (in no particular order)

- Figure out how viewing other submissions should work (lower scores etc...)
- User total score
- Think about best way to handle square image issue (should I crop before putting in db?)
- Bring completed challenges and leaderboard to par with the feed component
- Share to twitter button
- Type the trpc endpoints that are returning anys
- Fix firefox scrollbar not looking like chrome (the width needs to be the same because it is used in a css calc and leads to something being off center (by a couple pixels) in firefox)

- Fix suspense layout problems (which pages even need this?)

- Commenting on challenges?
- Deleting challenges (think about deleting in general (should this delete scores?, etc...))
- COME UP WITH A MORE INTERESTING HOOK FOR THIS SITE!

- Improve feed
- Options for trim and case sensitivity in problem creation?
